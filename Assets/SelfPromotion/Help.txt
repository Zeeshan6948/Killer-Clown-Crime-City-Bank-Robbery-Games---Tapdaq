the plugin works on file link of json in a specific formate
there are two scripts JsonController should on the first scene and only provide link of Json to it.
the adgetter script is for the image where ad should appear for that use Image and button and drop the script over it and you can give a specifc index for ad to show or may choose random.


example of Data formate style


{
    "Items": [
        {
            "Link": "Associated Link",
            "PicLink": "Image Link"
        },
        {
            "Link": "Associated Link",
            "PicLink": "Image Link"
        }
    ]
}
